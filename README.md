#BabyFace

The original Idea of babyface was to create a platform where parents could connect with other local parents in the area and organise playdates.

###challenges
The biggest challenged I faced during this project was creating a live messaging function using Action Cable. I really wanted to challenge myself and try something new I hadn't done before.
As soon as I introduced more then one person to the application it crashed.

I will come back to this project at a later date and try to get it up a running properly.
In hind sight, I probably should have created a smaller project and maybe building the live messaging on it's own.

In future I would probably use Elixir for the messaging function.
